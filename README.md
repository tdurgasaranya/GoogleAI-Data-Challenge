- Category : Women and girl’s Economic Equality and Leadership Subject: Tech Layoffs impact on Women economically and professionally

## Introduction
The technology sector has long been a male-dominated industry, where women have faced various barriers, including gender bias in hiring, retention, and promotion. This inequality has become more apparent during periods of economic downturn, particularly during mass layoffs. Recent data and studies suggest that women have been disproportionately affected by tech layoffs, exacerbating the gender gap in the industry. This paper explores the extent of gender bias in tech layoffs, analyzing the impact on women’s employment and financial stability, and offering insights into the contributing factors behind this disparity.

## Summary

Gender bias in tech layoffs is a significant issue that disproportionately affects women, exacerbating the gender gap in the industry. Women are not only more likely to be laid off but also face greater financial losses and longer periods of unemployment. The structural factors contributing to this bias—such as underrepresentation in leadership, lower wages, and concentration in non-essential roles—require urgent attention. By implementing targeted policies and support mechanisms, the tech industry can move toward greater gender equity and ensure that women are not disproportionately affected by future layoffs.
